    To use CSS style rules in the HTML Designer, the targetSchema property of your HTML document must be set to a Web browser that supports HTML 4.0 or higher. Older Web browsers that support only HTML 3.2 or earlier will simply ignore CSS styles. When the targetSchema property is set to an older Web browser, the integrated development environment (IDE) conceals CSS options and properties that are only available in more recent browsers. When the targetSchema property is set to a browser that does support HTML 4.0, CSS style rules become the preferred method for specifying the desired appearance and position of HTML elements.
